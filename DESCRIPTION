Description: Allows for identification of cell sub-populations within tissue samples using
  Bayesian multivariate mixture models with spatial random effects to account for a wide range of 
  spatial gene expression patterns, as described in Allen et. al, 2021 <doi:10.1101/2021.06.23.449615>.
  Bayesian inference is conducted using efficient Gibbs sampling implemented using 'Rcpp'.
